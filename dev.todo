TODO:
	▫ Figure out how to properly tune k_filter
	▫ Figure out if evaluation is correct

CLAHE:
	▫ Figure out how to not mess up the color
	▫ Implement non-2x2 interpolation [https://claude.ai/chat/bdb0cfaf-7b3c-4627-b3d8-79b9a6a481be]

Improvements:
	▫ Don't update kalman filter for first x frames

ByteTrack:
	Issues:
		▫ Objects coming into frame have growing bboxes, making kalman_filter think that they are expanding, which then also messes up velocity
			▫ Don't update kalman filter for first x frames
			▫ Implemented: dont render tracklet for first x frames
